so i am looking to create a lawyer directory

Once the customers come to my site they will select their type of law
,injury,accident,child support,immigration ect once they select this they will see a list of states
,once they select a state they will see a list of cities
once they select the city they will see a list of lawyers in that area for that area of law.

Can someone help me please..
